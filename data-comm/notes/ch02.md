# Chapter 02: Signals

###What's the point?
* To communicate you give arbitrary meaning to some signal
* By signal, that's meant as a gesture, action, sound, glyph/symbol, electrical impulse, radio wave, etc.
* The signal itself has no intrinsic meaning; we impose a meaning on it

###Arbitrary Meanings to Words
The word baba, means
* Father in Ojibwe
* Baby in Mexico
* Grandmother in Russia
* Saliva in Puerto Rico
* It is an honorific in Turkish
* It is sponge cake

The same can be said for the signals used in data communication
* When you look at a signal, you have to be wary of jumping to conclusions about how it is used

###Encoding
* In CS the process of giving meaning to a signal is called encoding.
* As you saw in the previous slide, different signals can have the same encoding
* And a signal is meaningless unless you know the encoding
* So encoding is what turns a signal into data

###Signal vs. Data
* A signal is not data, unless you know the encoding
* Keep these two concepts apart

###Transmitting Data
How you encode data also depends on the medium you are using.
* Sign language as opposed to spoken language, or written language.
* Think about the icons we use
* In CS, we tend to think of wired technologies, and wireless, but there is also fiber
* Obviously, the media in each of these lend themselves to different type of signal
Wired
* But even with wired technologies you have simple wires, twisted pair, coax, etc
* Signals travel differently in each of these, and some methods are more efficient than others depending on the type of wire

###Serial vs. Parallel
So, let’s just focus on sending a set of bits through wires  
One thing you can do is pass 1 bit at a time down a single wire.
* BTW, this is often done with 2 wires for electrical reasons, but not always.
* For example, cable is a single wire wrapped by a shield. The shield protects the signal transmission, but is not used for signalling
* Inside a controlled environment, like in a CPU or on a motherboard, you can use parallel for very fast communication
* In less controlled environments, you will most likely encounter serial

###Serial
* One bit at a time is serial communication
 * One bit comes through, then another, and another, until you have a byte, or word. Then you start on another byte
* Serial transmission is very common, whether wired or wireless
* Most LANs use serial communication
* USB is serial

###Parallel
* If you use a bunch of serial type systems together, you can send the data in parallel
 * For example, if you have 8 (or 9 – one for parity) wires, you can send a byte at a time, by sending a bit on each one of the wires
* Really fast communication (in controlled environments) often use parallel.
* The data buses inside the computer use parallel communication
 * Memory
 * Peripheral controllers
* You can send several bytes in one clock tick

**CONS:**  
* Parallel data transfer is actually pretty tricky
* As communication gets faster, you start to run into problems
 * Cross talk (interference of one wire with another)
 * Slight signal delays caused by small differences in wire length
* Sometimes it’s easier to just make the serial communication faster

###Going from Parallel to Serial
* Inside your computer there is a lot of parallel communication occurring (and some serial)
* The peripheral controllers communicate using parallel, but to communicate outside your machine serial is used
* Not only that, but internally your machine transfers data much faster than outside
* You get a buffer, you get a buffer, everyone gets a buffer
* A buffer holds data until it can be transmitted
* Data is sent very quickly and stuffed into a buffer
* The peripheral controller can now take its sweet time sending it

###Peripheral Controllers
* Network Interface Controller (NIC) Card to communicate to the network
* USB Controller - Universal Serial Bus
* Bluetooth controllers
* SCSI controllers
* FireWire (deprecated hardware)
* Thunderbolt

###Asynchronous vs. Synchronous
We want to send a byte using a serial connection
* This is actually somewhat complicated
* The source and destination have to communicate at the same speed and use the same protocol
* You have to make sure no one else is transmitting
* Let’s assume that this is the case
* You’re ready to send. How does the receiver know when you start sending? What if you start with a series of 1 bits, and that looks like no signal.
* There are 2 basic ways to handle this
 * Asynchronous – alert the receiver
 * Synchronous – the receiver is always expecting

####Asynchronous
We want to send a byte using a serial connection
* This is actually somewhat complicated
 * The source and destination have to communicate at the same speed and use the same protocol
 * Let’s assume that this is the case
 * You’re ready to send. How does the receiver know when you start sending? What if you start with a series of 1 bits, and that looks like no signal.

**Asynchronous Connections**  
* To transmit data from sender to receiver, an asynchronous connection creates a one-character package called a frame
* Added to the front of the frame is a start bit, while a stop bit is added to the end of the frame
* An optional parity bit can be added which can be used to detect errors
* The term asynchronous is misleading here because you must always maintain synchronization between the incoming data stream and the receiver
* Asynchronous connections maintain synchronization by using small frames with a leading start bit

**Synchronous Connections**  
* A synchronous connection creates a large frame that consists of header and trailer flags, control information, optional address information, error detection code, and data
* A synchronous connection is more elaborate but transfers data in a more efficient manner

**Isochronous Connections**  
* A third type of connection is used to support real-time applications
* Data must be delivered at just the right speed (real-time) – not too fast and not too slow
* Typically an isochronous connection must allocate resources on both ends to maintain real-time
* USB and Firewire can both support isochronous

###Interfaces
* Connecting peripheral devices to a computer has, in the past, been a fairly challenging task
* Newer interfaces have made this task much easier
* Let’s examine the interface between a computer and a device
 * This interface occurs primarily at the physical layer

**Interfacing a Computer to Peripheral Devices**  
* The connection to a peripheral is often called the interface
* The process of providing all the proper interconnections between a computer and a peripheral is called interfacing

**Characteristics of Interface Standards**  
There are essentially two types of standards
* Official standards
 * Created by standards-making organizations such as ITU (International Telecommunications Union), IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers), (now defunct) EIA (Electronic Industries Association), ISO (International Organization for Standardization), and ANSI (American National Standards Institute)
* De facto standards
 * Created by other groups that are not official standards but because of their widespread use, become “almost” standards

There are four possible components to an interface standard:
* Electrical component: deals with voltages, line capacitance, and other electrical characteristics
* Mechanical component: deals with items such as the connector or plug description
* Functional component: describes the function of each pin or circuit that is used in a particular interface
* Procedural component: describes how the particular circuits are used to perform an operation

**Two Important Interface Standards**  
In order to better understand the four components of an interface, let’s examine two interface standards
* EIA-232F – an older standard originally designed to connect a modem to a computer
* USB (Universal Serial Bus) – a newer standard that is much more powerful than EIA-232F

An Early Standard: EIA-232F
* Originally named RS-232 but has gone through many revisions
* All four components are defined in the EIA-232F standard:
 * Electrical
 * Mechanical (DB-25 connector and DB-9 connector)
 * Functional
 * Procedural
* EIA-232F also used the definitions DTE and DCE
 * An example of a DTE, or data terminating equipment, is a computer
 * An example of a DCE, or data circuit-terminating equipment, is some form of modem
* 25-pin connector
* 9-pin connector (e.g. DB9)

**What is meant by** ***duplexity***
**?**  
* EIA-232F defines a full-duplex connection.  What does this mean?
* A full-duplex connection transmits data in both directions and at the same time
* A half-duplex connection transmits data in both directions but in only one direction at a time
* A simplex connection can transmit data in only one direction
Can you think of a modern example of each?

**Universal Serial Bus (USB)**  
* The USB interface is a modern standard for interconnecting a wide range of peripheral devices to computers
* Supports plug and play
* Can daisy-chain multiple devices
* USB 2.0 can support 480 Mbps (USB 1.0 is only 12 Mbps)
* USB 3.0 can support 4.8 Gbps, usually has blue in the connector. 3.1 up to 10 Gbps
* The USB interface defines all four components
* The electrical component defines two wires VBUS and Ground to carry a 5-volt signal, while the D+ and D- wires carry the data and signaling information
* The mechanical component precisely defines the size of four different connectors and uses only four wires (the metal shell counts as one more connector)
* Uses twisted pairs
* The functional and procedural components are fairly complex but are based on the polled bus
* The computer takes turns asking each peripheral if it has anything to send
* More on polling later
* Up to 127 devices on a controller
* Usually half-duplex, but USB 3 supports full-duplex
* Micro connectors are the most durable
* USB 3.0 uses 8b/10b encoding; 3.1 uses 128b/132b
* Sleep and charge ports have yellow
* 3 modes of communication
 * Isochronous: streaming
 * Bulk transfer: synchronous with no guaranteed rate (file like transfer)
 * Interrupt transfers: synchronous with small payloads (mouse/keyboards)
* USB Type-C Connector
 * Designed to be ‘expandable’
 * 24 pins, reversible
 * 2 pairs for USB 2.0
 * 4 pairs for high-speed
 * Has a configurable features such as scalable
power charging and is bidirectional
 * Can support other protocols using same port
and cable such as HDMI, or DisplayPort

**Data Rate**  
Data rate is the speed data can be transmitted
* It is measured in bits per second (bps)
* The formula is: `(data rate) * time = (bits transmitted)`
	* bps * seconds = bits
* You can use basic algebra to get the time, and data rate from the other two
* Everybody likes jargon
* Just like we have kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes and terabytes, we have kilobits per second, megabits per second, gigabits per second, terabits per second

###Converting Data into Signals
There are four main combinations of data and signals:
 * Analog data transmitted using analog signals
 * Digital data transmitted using digital signals
 * Digital data transmitted using discrete analog signals
 * Analog data transmitted using digital signals

**Transmitting Analog Data with Analog Signals**  
* In order to transmit analog data, you can modulate the data onto a set of analog signals
* Broadcast radio and the older broadcast television are two very common examples of this
* We modulate the data onto another set of frequencies so that all the different channels can coexist at different frequencies

**Transmitting Digital Data with Digital Signals: Digital Encoding Schemes**  
There are numerous techniques available to convert digital data into digital signals. Let’s examine five:
* NRZ-L
* NRZI
* Manchester
* Differential Manchester
* Bipolar AMI
These are used in LANs and some telephone systems

Non-return to Zero Digital Encoding Schemes
* Non-return to zero-level (NRZ-L) transmits 1s as zero voltages and 0s as positive voltages
* Non-return to zero inverted (NRZI) has a voltage change at the beginning of a 1 and no voltage change at the beginning of a 0
* Fundamental difference exists between NRZ-L and NRZI
 * With NRZ-L, the receiver has to check the voltage level for each bit to determine whether the bit is a 0 or a 1,
 * With NRZI, the receiver has to check whether there is a change at the beginning of the bit to determine if it is a 0 or a 1

Manchester Digital Encoding Schemes
* Note how with a Differential Manchester code, every bit has at least one significant change.  Some bits have two signal changes per bit (baud rate = twice bps)
* With Manchester, the change in the signal tell you the bit. If it goes up in the middle of the bit, it’s a 1 if it goes down it’s a 0
* With Manchester, the change in the signal tell you the bit. If it goes up in the middle of the bit, it’s a 1 if it goes down it’s a 0 (or the other way around

Bipolar-AMI Encoding Scheme
* The bipolar-AMI encoding scheme is unique among all the encoding schemes because it uses three voltage levels
 * When a device transmits a binary 0, a zero voltage is transmitted
 * When the device transmits a binary 1, either a positive voltage or a negative voltage is transmitted
 * Which of these is transmitted depends on the binary 1 value that was last transmitted

Issues with NRZ and Manchester
* NRZ – you can have long strings of bits where the signal doesn’t change.
 * Voltages can drift
 * Hard to keep synchronized
* Manchester – self synchronizing
* Baud is twice bit rate
